We will start out learning all the vowels. The first lesson contains four vowels

between them when learning. Click on characters to play the sound they make.`,

first consonant. In Devanagari, all consonants are used together with a vowel to form a pair.
When a vowel is combined, it changes its appearance. This means you will need
to re-learn every vowel from scratch (*sad trombone sounds*). The default vowel is "अ" ("a"),
so every consonant is automatically paired with "a" unless otherwise noted. We will look
at the consonant "क" ("k") to see how these pairs are constructed.`,
