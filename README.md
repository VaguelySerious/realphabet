Practice alphabets of different languages.

I'm currently working on Japanse Hiragana/Katakana.

## TODO

### Japanese

Japanese features in work:

- Add options for Dakuten and Yoon characters
- Maintain selected characters after coming back from practice
- Store settings in local storage
- Add option for archaic symbols
- Use whole words and sentences for practice.

Planned alphabets:

- Hangul (Korean)
- Devanagari (Hindi)
- Cyrillic (Russian)

After that I'll do Korean Hangul and Hindi Devanagari.
